# Food-drive-clustering
In this project the data that was collected for Food drive 2023 is used and clustering is done on it to find the neighborhoods that contribute the most to donation bags collected. 
In this project algorithms like K-Means or hierarchical clustering are used. These methods can help identify inherent groupings within the data. In this Lab, we will be using K-Means clustering algorithm, which is widely used for its simplicity and effectiveness.
